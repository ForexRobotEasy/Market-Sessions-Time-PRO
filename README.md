# Market Sessions Time PRO

This code is a sample implementation of the 'Market Sessions Time PRO' indicator for MetaTrader 5 (mql5). It provides functionality to determine and display the current market session based on the current time. The market sessions include London, New York, Sydney, and Tokyo. It also allows customization of the chart by adding custom indicators or objects, such as vertical lines to represent market open and close times.

## How It Works

### Initialization

The `OnInit` function is called when the indicator is initialized. It sets the correct timezone for the chart and calculates the market open and close times for each session based on the current GMT time and the timezone offset. The timezone offset is adjusted by 1 if Daylight Saving Time is in effect. The function returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate successful initialization.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the indicator is deinitialized. It clears the global variables, including the market open and close times, and the current session.

### Custom Chart Representation

The `CustomizeChart` function can be used to customize the chart by adding custom indicators or objects. In this sample code, it adds vertical lines to represent the market open and close times. The `ObjectCreate` function is used to create the vertical lines, and the `ObjectSet` function is used to set the color of the lines.

### Real-time Updates of Market Sessions

The `UpdateMarketSessions` function is called in the `OnTick` function to determine the current market session based on the current time. It checks the hour of the current GMT time and assigns the corresponding session based on the hour ranges. The current session is stored in the `currentSession` variable. The function also displays the current market session on the chart using the `Comment` function.

### Clear and Understandable Market Status View

The `DisplayMarketStatus` function is called in the `OnTick` function to display the market status based on the current session. It uses a switch statement to assign the appropriate market status message based on the current session. The market status message is stored in the `marketStatus` variable. The function displays the market status on the chart using the `Comment` function.

### The Main Trading Function

The `OnTick` function is the main trading function that is called on each tick of the price. It updates the market sessions and displays the market status by calling the `UpdateMarketSessions` and `DisplayMarketStatus` functions. After that, you can add your own trading logic.
